# README
Concept: the purpose of this app is for GCs who manage multiple trades to be able to dole out tasks to each trade and get status updates on those tasks all in one place while also allows the trades themselves to keep up to date of the progression of their neighboring trades.

Each trade will have a page that basically works like a to do list. Tasks will be posted by the GC as they come up so workers will be able to check throughout the day to see what’s scheduled. As tasks are completed they can be marked as done and be pushed to review for the head of department to confirm completion. This will serve as an archive for who did what as well as a way to confirm the right work is getting done.

Example: st. johns episcopal is a hospital in far rollaways on long island. Their head of engineering, tom farzetta, manages all the trades responsible for daily maintenance of the building as well as emergency calls for repairs and whatnot. tom is constantly running around trying to get ahold of workers via walkie talkie and more often than not he won’t even get a response back. On top of that if something does get done he rarely knows which member of the team did the task or how they did it because there’s no log of who does what. My app could help him out a lot because whenever he gets a call for a repair or emergency he can just add it to the teams todo list and and everyone will have access to these tasks from their phones giving them no reason to say they didn’t know about a task. To solve the mystery of who did what when you complete a task and push it to review your name then gets added to the task and can be referred to later if an issue comes up due to the work they did. Id like to also implement stats to show the productivity and performance of each trade based on the difficulty of tasks and how long it takes to complete them as well as number of tasks done per day. The stats would work as an incentive to work harder and keep up with the other trades because your performance is all out in the open for everyone to see.

gems
- cors-rack

npm packages
- moment

mvp
- my mvp will be an app where a gc can add tasks to a trade and workers will be able to mark as complete ill seed the data for a gc, company and some trade and focus on the task creating and completing functionality for mvp and worry about creating more gcs and companies with more trades later one.

wireframes:
- .jpegs of the wireframes can be found in the folder called tradeSync_wireframes
